# üé§ Vidura: Your Voice Assistant

Welcome to **Vidura**, your interactive voice assistant that helps you with various tasks, provides information, and learns from your preferences! This project is built using Python, leveraging speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and the Gemini API for intelligent responses.

## üì¶ Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Understands your voice commands and queries.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds back with clear audio.
- **Current Time & Date**: Easily ask for the current time and date.
- **Web Actions**: Open websites in various modes (e.g., incognito).
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Fetches intelligent responses using the Gemini API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

# Voice Assistant

A voice-activated assistant that leverages the Gemini API for real-time responses and predictions. The assistant can perform various tasks such as telling the current time and date, answering questions, and opening websites.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes SpeechRecognition to understand user commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Implements `pyttsx3` for interactive responses.
- **Real-time Information**: Fetches current time and date dynamically.
- **Web Interaction**: Opens specified websites based on user commands.
- **Question Answering**: Uses Gemini API to answer user queries.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality
- `SpeechRecognition` for voice command capture
- `datetime` for real-time date and time retrieval
- Gemini API for intelligent responses and predictions
